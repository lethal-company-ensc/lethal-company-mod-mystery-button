# Mystery Button

## Introduction

MysteryButton is a mod for Lethal Company that adds a new enemy to the game: a button.

No one knows what this button does. It could make you rich or bring disastrous and chaotic consequences.

Will you dare to press it?

## Origin

This mod was born out of frustration. We had found a mod featuring a big red button that you werenâ€™t supposed to press, but its only effect was killing everyone in the facility.  
On a whim, we decided to create our own mod to enhance our gaming experience even further.

After several weeks of beta testing, we decided to share this mod with the community.
